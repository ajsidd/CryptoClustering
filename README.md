## Introduction

Cryptocurrency market data often contains numerous features, and clustering them can provide valuable insights into their behavior and relationships. This project utilizes K-Means clustering algorithm to cluster cryptocurrencies based on their market performance.

## Usage

### Requirements

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- hvplot
- scikit-learn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajsidd/CryptoClustering.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook `crypto_clustering.ipynb` to execute the analysis.

## Results

The analysis involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: The cryptocurrency market data is loaded from a CSV file and scaled using StandardScaler.

2. **Finding Optimal k**: The Elbow method is utilized to find the optimal number of clusters (k) both using the original data and PCA-transformed data.

3. **Clustering**: Cryptocurrencies are clustered using K-Means algorithm with the optimal k obtained from the previous step.

4. **Visualizations**: Visualizations such as scatter plots and composite plots are created to visualize the clustering results.

## Conclusion

Using K-Means clustering algorithm, cryptocurrencies are clustered based on their market performance. The analysis provides insights into how cryptocurrencies behave and allows for better understanding of their relationships.
